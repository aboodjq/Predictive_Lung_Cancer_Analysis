## Abstract

This research evaluates symptomatic indicators such as coughing, smoking, and chest discomfort using machine learning techniques to support early and accurate lung cancer diagnosis. The dataset, comprising both secondary data from a small database and primary data collected via surveys with medical and data science experts, underwent preprocessing to address imbalances using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE).

Key findings include:  
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest models achieving high test accuracy (95.37%).  
- Emphasis on the need for diverse data collection, frequent model updates, and the incorporation of multimodal data for enhanced predictive accuracy.

Future research focuses on expanding real-time datasets and refining predictive models to improve clinical applications and early lung cancer detection.
